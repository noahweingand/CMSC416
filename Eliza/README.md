## Description
eliza.py is a Python project that emulates the early natural language processing program created in 1966 by MIT AI Lab by Joseph Weizenbaum. There are many examples available online.

## Installation
To interact with Eliza, run eliza.py with no parameters in terminal or via cmd-line with Python 3. Instructions will be presented when you execute the file.

## Example
Eliza works best if you stick with brief string responses.

```
Eliza: What is your name?
User enters: Noah
Eliza: Hello Noah, how are you today?
User enters: Very bad.
Eliza: Tell me more!
User enters: I was late to class.
Eliza: Why is that?
User enters: Because my car was towed
Eliza: How do you know that your car was towed?
User enters: It was gone when I left this morning.
Eliza: Do you think this infers anything about you?
User enters: That I'm forgetful
Eliza: Why might this be?
User enters: bye
```
