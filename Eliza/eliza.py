# HOW IT WORKS?
# -------------
# The program starts by having the user input their name and storing it for reference. If at any moment, after the name is received, the user enters 'bye',
# the program will quit. After entering their name, Eliza will ask a user how they are. The user enters a response and that response is lowercased to limit
# errors in capitalization. The response is sent to the getResponse method where it will look for a match in the response list. After a match is found,
# it randomly chooses a reply from the responses associated with the regex it matched. The match groups are then passed to a reflect method to stage them
# either as a question or in the second-person. The reflect method returns the reflected words to the getResponse method which formats the reflected words 
# with the randomly selected response the regex matcher found. Then it prints a formatted reply. The user will reply back and the algorithm repeats until
# a user ends it.
